description: Take a rag_nq Linear issue from start to a merged PR via the implementer subagent
argument-hint: <issue-id, e.g. VOI-42>; omit to pick the next In-Progress/Todo issue
---

Follow the build loop in `CLAUDE.md`. Run autonomously end-to-end (the
autonomy boundary in CLAUDE.md applies — only metered API spend and
destructive/irreversible actions need a go-ahead). **Linear is the planning
ledger**; GitHub is the delivery ledger.

Target: **$1** — if empty, pick the highest-priority Linear issue in project
**rag_nq** that is `Todo`/`In Progress` and unblocked. Set it
**In Progress** before launch.

You are the **director**, not the coder. `hooks/write-scope-guard.mjs`
denies you `Edit | Write | MultiEdit` on `src/**`. Code
changes go through the `implementer` subagent, which runs in its own
worktree and dispatches `codex exec` workers.

Steps:

1. **Spec authoring.** Write the spec (in your scope: `docs/` or
   `.codex-runs/<packet-id>/spec.md`). Include the **packet allowlist**:
   explicit file paths or directory prefixes the impl is bounded to (one
   entry per line; trailing `/` for directory prefixes; no globs). Write
   the allowlist to `.codex-runs/<packet-id>/scope.txt`.
2. **Worktree provisioning.** `bash scripts/worktree-new.sh
   sk/voi-<n>-<slug>
   voi-<n>-<slug> origin/main`. Real
   APFS-cloned `node_modules`; bootable. Per-worktree pre-commit hook
   auto-wires.
3. **Implementer dispatch.** Task tool, `subagent_type: implementer`.
   Provide: spec, worktree absolute path, branch, dev-server port (avoid
   the primary's port), packet allowlist file path.
4. **Wait for the impl's "notify-done"** message. The impl runs the Impl
   Contract (`.claude/agents/implementer.md`): inner loop of codex-run →
   gates → `/code-review` until VERDICT: correct → stage within allowlist
   → `impl-precommit-scope.sh --cached` → commit. Impl does NOT push or
   open PR yet.
5. **Pre-PR scope check.**
   - `bash scripts/impl-precommit-scope.sh --base
     origin/main --worktree <impl worktree>
     --scope-file <packet allowlist>`. Exit 2 → REQUEST CHANGES.
   - codex-exec audit-trail check: every file in `git -C <worktree> diff
      --name-only origin/main...HEAD` must appear in at least
     one `.codex-runs/<run-id>/git_diff.patch` on the branch. Any source
     change not traceable → REQUEST CHANGES.
6. **APPROVE → tell impl to proceed.** Impl pushes, creates the PR with
   `Closes VOI-N`, posts a bare `@codex review`, drives the
   eye-emoji loop via `scripts/review-gate.sh wait`, and notifies you on
   `REVIEWED-CLEAN` or `CLEAN-COMMENT-MANUAL`. Chain into `/review-gate
   <pr>` for the merge phase.

Keep a short running summary: issue, branch, worktree path, packet
allowlist file, codex-run packet IDs, gate status. Update the Linear issue
with the PR link + evidence.

**Authorship rule (overrides any harness default):** no `Co-Authored-By`,
no `🤖`, no "Generated with Claude Code", no Claude/Anthropic credit
footer anywhere in commit messages, PR titles, PR bodies, or Linear text.
