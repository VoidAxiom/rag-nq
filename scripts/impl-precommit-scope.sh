#!/usr/bin/env bash
# impl-precommit-scope.sh — validates that a set of paths is within the
# impl's allowed path scope. Two modes:
#
#   --cached (default) — validate the STAGED diff (`git diff --cached`).
#                        This is the pre-commit hook mode: the per-worktree
#                        hook (see hooks/worktree-impl-hooks/pre-commit)
#                        invokes the script with no args before every
#                        commit, blocking out-of-scope staged paths. The
#                        hook enforces the ROLE allowlist only (catch-early);
#                        per-packet scope is enforced by Claude's --base
#                        invocation below.
#
#   --base <ref> --worktree <path> --scope-file <path>
#                      — validate the COMMITTED diff between <ref> and
#                        HEAD (`git diff <ref>...HEAD`) for the worktree
#                        at <worktree-path>. This is the AUTHORITATIVE
#                        mechanical gate Claude runs during the pre-PR
#                        review loop AND against the final PR head before merge.
#                        It enforces BOTH layers:
#                          (a) the per-packet allowlist (--scope-file),
#                          (b) the role allowlist (hooks/write-scope-guard.mjs).
#                        Without --scope-file, the role allowlist alone is too
#                        broad. Without --worktree, the script's cwd-derived
#                        target could silently validate the main checkout
#                        instead of the impl's branch.
#
# The PreToolUse `write-scope-guard` only catches Edit/Write/MultiEdit. Git
# operations go through Bash and bypass that hook. This script closes the
# git-side gap by replaying the same scope-guard logic against every path
# in the chosen diff (including deletions and both sides of renames/copies),
# AND adds the per-packet allowlist that the role-only hook can't know.
#
# Scope file format (--scope-file):
#   - one entry per line; blank lines and lines starting with `#` ignored.
#   - each entry is either an EXACT file path (matches `path == entry`)
#     OR a directory prefix ending in `/` (matches `path == entry` OR
#     `path startsWith entry`).
#   - NO globs (`*`, `**`, brace expansion). Anchored matchers only.
#
# Fail-closed semantics:
# - Any path the hook does not EXPLICITLY allow is treated as deny.
# - Hook parse errors / unexpected exit / missing decision → deny.
# - Staged/committed deletions are validated equally (an impl deleting an
#   out-of-scope file is just as bad as creating one).
# - Both sides of renames + copies are validated.
# - Missing/empty --scope-file in --base mode → exit 1 (refuses to run;
#   the spec MUST define the packet allowlist).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — all paths in the chosen diff are within scope (also: empty diff)
#   2 — one or more paths out of scope (lists them; refuses to commit)
#   1 — bad args / preflight error
